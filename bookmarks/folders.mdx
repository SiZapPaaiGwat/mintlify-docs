Twillot supports bookmark categorization, allowing you to group bookmarks for easier management.

<Tip>X/Twitter also offers a bookmark feature, but it is not free.</Tip>

## Create a Folder

In the left navigation under Folders, enter your folder name in the input box at the bottom and press Enter to create a folder.

## Delete a Folder

In the left navigation under Folders, find the folder you want to delete, hover over it, and click the trash icon to delete the folder.

<Tip>
  Deleting a folder will not delete the bookmarks within it. The bookmarks will be moved to the default folder (Unsorted).
</Tip>

## Move a Single Bookmark to a Folder

In the bookmark list item, click the folder move icon and select the corresponding folder to move it.

## Batch Move Multiple Bookmarks to a Folder

After entering a keyword search, hover over the folder name under Folders on the left, and click the folder move icon to batch move bookmarks to that folder.

## Folder Sync

Twillot will automatically sync the folders you create in X/Twitter, along with the bookmarks within them. This sync process is one-way, meaning it only syncs from X/Twitter to Twillot. Folders created in Twillot will not automatically sync to X/Twitter.
